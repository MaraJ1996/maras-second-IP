This repository is for my second IP, 'Triangle Tracker'. This web page allows the user to input three triangle side lengths, returning the type of triangle: equilateral, isosceles, scalene or invalid.
# Triangle Tracker
#### Calculator Determining Triangle Type , November 2018
#### By **Mara Jackson**
## Description
This project is essentially a calculator and triangle categorizing tool in one. This Triangle Tracker must function as a calculator in its ability to take the value for any three given side lengths and determine how they factor into the provided parameters in Javascript. By finding an equation that fits the given values, this Triangle Tracker is able to determine the type of triangle the sides form and display that name to the user.  
## SetUp/Usage
* Determine three side lengths (integers)
* Calculate their type of triangle
No setup or installation is needed to use this tool. Simply determine three triangle side values you'd like to use and plug them in to the designated spaces on the site. By pressing 'submit' the tracker will read the values, see how they factor into the parameters of various triangle types, and read the triangle type to you that your sides define.
## Bugs
When entering values that should describe a 'non triangle' , this tracker tends to read a random triangle type instead (though all three defined triangle types appear correctly when defined).
## BDD (Behavior Driven Development)
In order of simplest behavior:
* Links HTML and Javascript to webpage
* Determines text to appear at various places on webpage
* Establishes SideA, sideB and sideC as functioning variables
* Reads the command to exchange strings for applicable integers
* Applies given integers to parameters given
* Further categorizes integers based on application in 'if/else' statements
* Reads the command to categorize results by title, documents results
* Processes integer function within equations within 'if/else' statements and presents the triangle type results to user
